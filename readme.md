# Module 4: Javascript - API Consumption

I used the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to create a "Where to visit" randomizer, so that people can dream of foreign soil during this pandemic.

The information is loaded with async/await and the user can get a randomized country from the list. Once a country has been loaded, the user can choose to view more information. The user can also filter out world regions they do not want to visit.

I only did super minimal styling on this... so it's a little bit ugly.

I definitely have ideas of how to take this further, by allowing users to add countries to a wishlist, maybe connecting to the Google Maps API and showing the location on a map... and yeah, making it prettier overall. But that has to wait for a better moment in time.
